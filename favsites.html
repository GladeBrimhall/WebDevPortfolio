          <section><h1>Glade's Favorite Websites</h1>

              <p>Most of the websites Glade uses often are related to his hobbys.
                   There are many resources on the internet for the trading card game Magic the Gathering. 
                   He uses these to stay up to date on new cards, card combinations, and strategys. 
                   Glade is very competitive and likes to see the games he loves played at a high level.
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/">Twitch TV</a> is a website where people stream games and other media onto the web. Glade likes to watch professionals play games on Twitch.</p>
