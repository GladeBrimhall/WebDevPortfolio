                   <h1>Glade's Plans for the Future</h1>
                   <p>Glade is excited about the future. He has dreamed for a long time of playing in a large band (7-10 musicians).
                        He has taken guitar lessons for many years to prepare for playing in a band eventually.
                    He is learning how to code so he can get into a career that will let him afford to buy a home and so many guitars he doesn't have the time to play them all.
                He also wants to eventually create a website with instrustional videos and guitar lessons. He has learned music from many sources, but he thinks he has a unique
            view on learning music and would like to share that with people. </p>
