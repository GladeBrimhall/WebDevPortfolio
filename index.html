           <p>Hello, my name is <em>Glade David Brimhall</em> and this is a website that is all about me.
                I love music and have been playing guitar for 7 years.<br> My main love is funk music
                but i'm also a fan of blues, jazz, soul, hip-hop, reggae, and rock and roll. I love my dog Marsh,<br> he's a handsom, <strong>wild,</strong> and young Boston Terrier.
            </p>
