                <h2>Glade's Favorite Things</h2>
                  <h3>Funk Music</h3>
                    <p>Glade is very passionate about many styles of music. 
                      The main style of music he loves is funk music. 
                      Funk music was created by many people, but the majority
                       of the credit for pioneering the genre goes to
                        James Brown and Sly Stone.</p>

                 <h3>Strategy Games</h3>
                   <p>Another one of Glade's passions are strategy games.
                       Real time strategy or RTS games are Glade's favorite.
                       He has played such games as Starcraft 2 and Warcraft 3
                       for years. He is also a large fan of the trading card game Magic the Gathering.
