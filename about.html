                <h2>Glade's Favorite Things</h2>
                  <h3>Funk Music</h3>
                    <p>Glade is very passionate about many styles of music. 
                      The main style of music he loves is <strong>funk</strong>. 
                      Funk music was created by many people, but the majority
                       of the credit for pioneering the genre goes to
                        James Brown and Sly Stone.</p>

                 <h3>Strategy Games</h3>
                   <p>Another one of Glade's passions are strategy games.
                       Real time strategy or RTS games are Glade's favorite.
                       He has played such games as Starcraft 2 and Warcraft 3
                       for years. He is also a large fan of the trading card game Magic the Gathering.
